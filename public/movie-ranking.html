<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>In my opinion, the greatest anime to ever exist. Beautiful lore, character design, and character writing. </p>

<h3>The Vampire Diaries</h3>
<p>One of the best vampire series out there with good touches of romance. Stefan Salvatore is best character in my opinion.</p>

<h3>300</h3>
<p>THe greatest gladiator movie to have ever been created.</p>
